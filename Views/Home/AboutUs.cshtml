            <h4>WHO ARE WE ?</h4>
            <p>
                It happens millions of times each week – a customer receives a drink from
                a BrewByte – but each interaction is unique. It’s just a moment in time –
                just one hand reaching over the counter to present a cup to another
                outstretched hand. But it’s a connection....
            </p>
            <p>
                We make sure everything we do honors that connection – from our commitment
                to the highest quality coffee in the world, to the way we engage with our
                customers and communities to do business responsibly. From our beginnings
                as a single store over forty years ago, in every place that we’ve been,
                and every place that we touch, we've tried to make it a little better than
                we found it.
